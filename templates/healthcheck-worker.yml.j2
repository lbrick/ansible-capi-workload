  # (Optional) maxUnhealthy prevents further remediation if the cluster is already partially unhealthy
  #maxUnhealthy: 40%
  # (Optional) nodeStartupTimeout determines how long a MachineHealthCheck should wait for
  # a Node to join the cluster, before considering a Machine unhealthy.
  # Defaults to 10 minutes if not specified.
  # Set to 0 to disable the node startup timeout.
  # Disabling this timeout will prevent a Machine from being considered unhealthy when
  # the Node it created has not yet registered with the cluster. This can be useful when
  # Nodes take a long time to start up or when you only want condition based checks for
  # Machine health.
